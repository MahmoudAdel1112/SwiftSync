# SwyftSync

SwyftSync is an AI-powered tool I built to save time by automating workflows and syncing stuff fast. It’s all front-end vibes with HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript—no fancy backend or servers here. This README breaks down the tech I used and what I learned while hacking it together.

### SwyftSync runs on a simple stack:

* HTML: Semantic tags for structure, like section and header.
* CSS: Flexbox, Grid, and some animation for a slick, responsive look.
* JavaScript: Vanilla JS with localStorage for data and a basic task-sorting algorithm.
